# 🎨 Turtle Paint — Draw Like MS Paint Using Python!

**Turtle Paint** is a simple yet powerful drawing app built entirely in **Python** using the **Turtle Graphics** module.  
It lets you draw freely on the screen, erase sections, change pen colors on the fly, and more — all in full screen!

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Freehand Drawing** – Move your cursor and draw smoothly, just like in MS Paint.  
🧽 **Eraser Mode** – Press `E` to toggle erasing. The turtle turns into a rectangle to erase instantly.  
🖌️ **Pen Mode** – Click anywhere to resume drawing when pen mode is on.  
🎨 **Custom Colors** – Choose both **background** and **pen colors** before you start drawing.  
🌈 **Live Color Change** – Enter RGB values anytime to change your pen color mid-session.  
💾 **Clear Screen** – Press `C` to clear the canvas instantly.  
🔺 **Resizable Brush** – Use `+` to increase and `-` to decrease turtle (brush) size.  
🖥️ **Full-Screen Canvas** – Automatically opens in full-screen for a seamless drawing experience.  
🗒️ **Interactive Startup** – Displays a control guide and asks for confirmation before launching.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install Dependencies

No external libraries are needed — everything is built using the standard Python library!

## ▶️ How to Run
# Clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/painting-and-drawing.git```

# Navigate into the folder
```cd hand free drawing```

# Run the program
```python drawing.py```

## 🧠 How It Works

The app uses Python’s built-in turtle module to simulate drawing actions:

The turtle cursor acts as your brush.

When eraser mode is enabled, the pen color changes to the background color and shape becomes rectangular.

User interactions (keypresses, mouse clicks) are handled through Turtle’s event bindings.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

🖼️ Save drawings as image files (.png or .jpg)

🎚️ Add color picker GUI instead of RGB input

🧰 Add UI buttons for tools (pen, eraser, clear, etc.)
